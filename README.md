## TODO

Implementations:
- Implement dataset.py
- Implement inference.py
- Script for evaluation metrics

Training:
- swin_t train
- swin_s train
- resnet reference?

Writing:
- Contribution overview
- Experimental setup
- Results
- Conclusion
- References
- Instructions for running the models

## Contribution overview

TODO:

```
Highlight the changes you have made to existing work. Justify the reasons behind these changes (What do you want to improve? and How?). Itâ€™s better to use visuals to guide the reader to understand your work.
```

## Experimental setup

TODO:

```
What are the experiments you conducted? What are the evaluation
metrics?
```

## Dataset


We use the [CrowdPose dataset](https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/CrowdPose).
The repository contains the Google drive links for downloading the images and annotations.
Images should be downloaded under the [/data-crowdpose/images/](/data-crowdpose/images/) directory, and annotations under [/data-crowdpose/json/](/data-crowdpose/json/).

To avoid doing this manually, simply run the following script:

```bash
$ sh data.sh
```

Note: make sure to have `gdown` installed (provided in the `requirements.txt`).

## Results

TODO:

```
Qualitative and Quantitative results of your experiments
```

## Conclusion

TODO: short

## References

- OpenPifPaf, Swin

## Instructions for running the models

TODO:

```
Instructions to run and test model + links to download the models weights/checkpoints
```

All of our code can be found under the scripts folder:
- [scripts/dataset.py](scripts/dataset.py) for the CrowdPose dataset class
- [scripts/train.py](scripts/train.py) for training the models
- [scripts/inference.py](scripts/inference.py) for predictions
