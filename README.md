TODO: short description of the project at the end

# 1. Environment

# 2. Dataset

We use the [CrowdPose dataset](https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/CrowdPose).
The repository contains the Google drive links for downloading the images and annotations.
Images should be downloaded under the [/crowdpose/images/](/crowdpose/images/) directory, and annotations under [/crowdpose/annotations/](/crowdpose/annotations/).

To avoid doing this manually, simply run the following script:

```bash
$ sh data.sh
```

Note: run this in your container or install `gdown` with pip.

# 3. TODO

instructions to run and test model + links to download the models weights/checkpoints
